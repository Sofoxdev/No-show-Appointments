# No-show Appointment Dataset

## Introduction

The No-show appointments dataset contains the information of over a 100,000 patients in brazil who scheduled appointments with various hospitals in different locations in 2016. It contains information on if the patients showed up for their appointments or not.

Accross this project I used my current knowledge of data analysis and data wrangling to generate valuable insights from this dataset. 

My insights were be able to:

* examine the relationship between gender and the propensity to show up for scheduled appointments
* investigate the neighbourhood that has the highest percentage of no-show and the location that had the lowest and examine trends between them
* study if senior citizens have a higher propensity to adhere to their scheduled appointment than the younger ones
* identify the trends associated with patients who do not-show and those that show-up to appointments.
* explore if patients with scholarships show up more than patients without scholarships
